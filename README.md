# SUPER ULTRA MEGA CALCULATOR 3D

- **Buttons count:**
  - width: **4** blocks
  - height: **5** blocks

If each button have same height as **1** and width as **1.1**.\
The top part of calc is **1.5** height size.\
The bevel size on the edges of calc is equal to **0.1**\
So the full height is equal to **6.7** and **4.6** for the total width.
